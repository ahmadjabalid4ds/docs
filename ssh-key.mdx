## **SSH Key Generation 🔐**

SSH key pairs are essential for anyone in IT, especially when working with servers or pushing code to SCM systems like GitLab and GitHub. Consider your SSH key as a secure ID card—protect it well. Follow these steps to generate your SSH key.

**Generating an SSH Key 🛠️**To create your SSH key pair, run the following commands:

Copy

```shellscript
cd ~/.ssh
```

Copy

```shellscript
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

Copy

```shellscript
cat id_rsa.pub
```

**Important Notes:**

- During generation, you may be prompted to set a passphrase. While optional, adding a passphrase increases security, so consider using one you can remember.
- **Never share your private key** (`id_rsa` file) with anyone.
- The `.pub` file (e.g., `id_rsa.pub`) is your **public key** and can be shared for authentication. The other file (e.g., `id_rsa`) is your **private key** and must remain secure.

**Loading SSH Keys 🗝️**To verify if your SSH key is loaded, use the following command:

Copy

```shellscript
ssh-add -l
```

If no keys are listed, load your SSH key manually:

Copy

```shellscript
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

You’ll be prompted to enter your passphrase if you set one. Running`ssh-add -l`again should then show your loaded SSH key.
