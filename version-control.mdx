### Why Version Control? üåç

Learn how to update your docs locally and deploy them to the public

Version control systems are essential tools in our development workflow, allowing us to:

- **Record Code Evolution**: Keep a detailed log of every change.
- **Enable Collaboration**: Facilitate multiple developers working in parallel.
- **Easily Roll Back**: Revert to previous versions when necessary.
- **Ensure Code Stability**: Support consistent, production-ready code.

### [**‚Äã**](https://docs.wavez.tech/engineering/version-control#commit-message-standards-%F0%9F%93%9C)

**Commit Message Standards üìú**Clear, concise commit messages make it easy to understand the purpose of each code change. Our commit message categories help with consistency:

- **feat**: Adds a new feature.
- **fix**: Corrects an existing issue.
- **chore**: Handles routine updates like dependency changes.
- **refactor**: Improves code structure without altering functionality.
- **docs**: Updates documentation files.
- **style**: Applies non-functional formatting changes.
- **test**: Adds or modifies tests.
- **perf**: Enhances performance.
- **ci**: Adjusts continuous integration configurations.
- **build**: Modifies build scripts or dependencies.
- **revert**: Reverts a previous change.
- **meta**: Updates metadata like contributors or licenses.

**Example:**`"feat: Add user profile customization feature"`

### [**‚Äã**](https://docs.wavez.tech/engineering/version-control#branching-strategy-%F0%9F%8C%BF)

**Branching Strategy üåø**We follow a structured branching strategy to keep development organized and releases smooth.

- **Main Branch**: `main` is the production-ready branch where stable code resides, tagged for each release.
- **Develop Branch**: `develop` serves as the integration branch where tested features merge before release.
- **Feature Branch**: Named `feature/{feature-name}`, each new feature gets its own branch off `develop`.
- **Fix Branch**: Named `fix/{issue-identifier}`, these branches address non-critical bug fixes and merge back into `develop`.
- **Release Branch**: Named `release/{release-version}`, this branch finalizes a version for production with any last adjustments.
- **Hotfix Branch**: Named `hotfix/{issue-identifier}`, used for urgent fixes directly on `main`, then merged into both `main` and `develop`.

### [**‚Äã**](https://docs.wavez.tech/engineering/version-control#release-management-%F0%9F%9A%80)

**Release Management üöÄ**Our release management process ensures stability, quality, and consistency in production.

- **Planning**: Define release scope based on feature readiness.
- **Release Branch Creation**: Create a release branch from `develop` for final changes.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive tests validate the code before release.
- **Versioning**: Follow semantic versioning (X.Y.Z) where:
  - `X` = major release
  - `Y` = minor update
  - `Z` = patch

Example tag:

Copy

```shellscript
git tag -a v2.1.0 -m "Version 2.1.0 Release"
```

- **Deployment**: Publish to production with appropriate support.
- **Post-release Monitoring**: Observe the release for stability and gather user feedback.

### [**‚Äã**](https://docs.wavez.tech/engineering/version-control#change-log-management-%F0%9F%93%8B)

**Change Log Management üìã**A detailed change log provides a clear record of modifications. Each entry in our change log includes:

- **Type**: (e.g., `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Removed`)
- **Description**: Brief summary of the change.
- **Author**: Name of the contributor.
- **Merge Request Link**: URL to the relevant merge request.
- **Reference Link**: URL to the related issue or discussion.
- **Date**: Date of the change.

Example Entry:

Copy

```markdown
## [2.1.0] - 2024-11-14
### Added
- **Description**: Introduced enhanced profile customization.
- **Author**: Alex Rivera
- **Merge Request**: [#101](https://github.com/project/repo/merge_requests/101)
- **Reference**: [#210](https://github.com/project/repo/issues/210)
- **Date**: 2024-11-14
```

### [**‚Äã**](https://docs.wavez.tech/engineering/version-control#commit-naming-conventions-%F0%9F%96%8B%EF%B8%8F)

**Commit Naming Conventions üñãÔ∏è**For clarity, commit messages follow this standard format:

- **Type**: Action type (e.g., `Add`, `Fix`, `Update`, `Remove`).
- **Scope**: Project area (e.g., `profile`, `dashboard`).
- **Description**: Concise summary of the change.

Example: `Add(profile): Enable profile picture upload`
